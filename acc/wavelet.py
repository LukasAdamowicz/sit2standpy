        Fit the data and determine sit-to-stand transitions start and stop times.

        First, the data is filtered using the acc_filter.apply(). After which, the Continuous Wavelet Transform is
        taken of the reconstructed data. The CWT coefficients are summed in the specified power band, and peaks are
        found. Filtered data, power peaks, and CWT data are passed to the detector.apply() method, which detects the
        sit-to-stand transitions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        accel : numpy.ndarray
            (N, 3) array of raw accelerations measured by a lumbar sensor.

        detector: {pysit2stand.acc.StillnessDetector, pysit2stand.acc.SimilarityDetector}
            Initialized detector objects for detecting the sit-to-stand transisions. Must have an apply method. If
            creating a new object for this detection, see StillnessDetector.apply() for the required arguments.
        acc_filter : pysit2stand.AccFilter
